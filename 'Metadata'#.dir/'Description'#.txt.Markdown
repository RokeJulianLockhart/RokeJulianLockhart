		<h1>Mr. Beedell, Roke Julian Lockhart (RJLB)</h1>
	</li>
	<li>
		<p>I specialize in OS architectures, and GUI consistency, accessibility, and ease of use.</p>
	</li>
	<li>
		<p>I tend to utilize a combination of <code>cpe:/o:opensuse:tumbleweed</code> and <code>cpe:/o:fedoraproject:fedora</code>, with <code>cpe:/a:kde:plasma</code> as my desktop environment. I utilize Tumbleweed when I need to install onto a 32-bit BIOS or UEFI, and Fedora otherwise. I'd like to utilize Tumbleweed for everything due to its exclusive inclusion of YaST. However, its bug reporting infrastructure is painful to utilize due its lack of GNOME Abrt support and ancient Bugzilla, in stark constrast to the opposite for Fedora.</p>
